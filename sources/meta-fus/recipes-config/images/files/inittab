# Put a getty on the login_tty. login_tty is a symbolic link to the

# /etc/init.d/S01fssetup. /sbin/fsgetty is a script that simply starts
# the real /sbin/getty if the login_tty is a valid string. Otherwise it
# stays sleeping in an endless loop, because if it would return here, it
# would respawn immediately, and fail again and again, causing lots of
# annoying syslog messages.
